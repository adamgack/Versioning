Over the summer I stayed at home most of the time and worked for my dad.
I mostly did various things on my computer every day and then went to sleep.
The entire summer was a big blur to me.

During this summer I worked an IT internship designing a service dashboard using
PowerShell and Python. I worked partially remotely and partly in the office.

Over the summer I worked the entire time, ocasionally seeing friends and playing Magic the Gathering.
I played a few computer games, but never had the time for anything serious. I spent most of the summer
waiting for college to start back up honestly, even if that wasn't the safest path in my life.
I explored an abandoned wood mill and quarry too, that was really fun. I will keep those pictures forever.
Overall I'm just happy to be back in the swing of acedemia after a summer of worK.
