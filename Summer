Over the summer I stayed at home most of the time and worked for my dad.
I mostly did various things on my computer every day and then went to sleep.
The entire summer was a big blur to me.

During this summer I worked an IT internship designing a service dashboard using
PowerShell and Python. I worked partially remotely and partly in the office.
